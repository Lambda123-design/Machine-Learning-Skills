# Machine-Learning-Skills

**Following are just a overall skills of my Machine Learning Skills, on how I can add value to your organization:**

1. Data Cleaning
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   
3. Feature Engineering - Handling Missing Values, Handling Imbalanced Datasets (Undersampling, Oversampling - SMOTE, SMOTE with TOMEK), Handling Outliers, Feature Encoding (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Target Guided Encoding)

4. Feature Selection
   
5. Feature Scaling
    
6. Model Building:

**Supervised Machine Learning:**

(i) Linear Regression - Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet

(ii) Logistic Regression - One Versus Rest, Handling Imbalanced Datasets, ROC Curve
  
7. Cross Validation:
   
(i)  Leave One Out Cross Validation

(ii) Leave P Out Cross Validation

(iii) k-Fold Cross Validation

(iv) Stratified k-Fold Cross Validation

(v) Time Series Cross Validation
 
8. HyperParameter Tuning
    
9. Model Deployment

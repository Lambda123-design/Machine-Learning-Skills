**Following are just a overall skills of my Machine Learning Skills, on how I can add value to your organization:**

1. Data Cleaning
   
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
   
5. Feature Engineering - Handling Missing Values, Handling Imbalanced Datasets (Undersampling, Oversampling - SMOTE, SMOTE with TOMEK), Handling Outliers, Feature Encoding (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Target Guided Encoding)

7. Feature Selection
   
9. Feature Scaling
    
11. Model Building:
